# engine_beta
This is a simple graphics engine made mostly for fun and for learning openGL. Here is an incomplete list of its features:
-Collision detection for simple shapes
-Simple physics simulation (forces and force fields can be applied)
-Shadows through shadow volumes (doesn't work perfectly yet)
-Hierarchial object structure

## Compilation
The engine is compiled running the makefile. It requires the opengl libraries to be installed. In addition, SDL2 library is required for interfacing with X. The engine uses glm (https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html) to implement some fundamental linear algebra operations.
