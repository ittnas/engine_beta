This is a simple graphics engine made mostly for fun and for learning openGL. Here is an incomplete list of its features:
*Collision detection for simple shapes
*Simple physics simulation (forces and force fields can be applied)
*Shadows through shadow volumes (doesn't work perfectly yet)
*Hierarchial object structure
